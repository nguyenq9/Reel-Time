In order to setup our application's new framework we used the instructions provided at the link below: 

Use this link to install Android Studio and set up an Android Virtual Device
https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup?os=windows&platform=android

Launch the Virtual Device

Navigate to the app folder

While inside the app folder, run the command, npm install.

Then run the command, npm run android.

There will be a Configuration phase and an Executing phase. Once those complete the app will launch on the AVD.

On the very first use, be sure to create a new account.
